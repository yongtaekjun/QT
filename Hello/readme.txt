It is almost same concept with MFC ....

I trying to make a windows application with QCreator, QWidjet without manual and tutorial.
Thus, I know it is understandable .....

I will add some OpenGL/OpenCV, boost library library to this window.

Then, I will make some car controle window application.
  - this will connect to car which is controled by Raspberry.
  - GUI: need buttons - start, stop, speed up/down, left, right, forward, backword.
  - CUI: add command line to controle the car
  - VUI: Voice User Interface ... well ... I have no idea yet for this.
         maybe Microsoft Contana will talk to my application.
         
Raspberry Car Control Server is :
 -. listening socket connection from clients ....
 -. send say hello message
 -. control motor for moving.
 -. response the Ultra Sonic Sensor information for avoiding obstacles.
