# QT
for QT test and make utility

I just decided to start it 2017-11-29.
My favorate language is C++ because I can learn computer archtecture with it.
With the other mordern languages such like Java, Python, Go, Swift, C#,PHP, JavaScript, it is hard.

I believe QT is one of GUI tool like MS MFC which I got experience of that.

Installing the QT 5.9.3 took so long time ... it took over 10 hours .... still installing
I never seen this kind of huge library .... I didn't expect it ... it is over 15GB now .. 60% of completing ...


QT Creator is look like much lighter and simpler than VS ...
Anyway, I have to make the famous 'Hello QT !!'
It need kits ... sounds like kids ...
